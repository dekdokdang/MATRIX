## Introduction

MATRIX, or Modbus Attack Tool for Remote Industrial eXploitation, is a powerful tool designed for security testing of Modbus TCP protocol implementations. As industries increasingly rely on connected devices, the need for robust security measures becomes critical. MATRIX provides a comprehensive suite of features to assess vulnerabilities in industrial control systems (ICS) and cyber-physical systems (CPS).

This tool is open-source and aims to facilitate security research and education in the field of offensive security. Whether you're a researcher, a student, or a professional, MATRIX equips you with the capabilities to understand and test Modbus TCP systems effectively.
